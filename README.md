Facilities and Maintenance Survey Analysis Scripts 
{
  "projectContext": {
    "primaryGoal": "To audit and enhance a Google Apps Script-based reporting tool for Facilities & Maintenance (F&M) survey data from John Lewis and Waitrose concerning services by CBRE and PSS.",
    "coreObjectives": [
      "Identify which shops require the most support based on service quality.",
      "Analyze performance trends over time (latest survey vs. previous, overall trend).",
      "Rank top and bottom performers at various levels (Shop, CBRE Sector, Theme).",
      "Validate the consistency between quantitative scores and qualitative written feedback.",
      "Receive recommendations for new, valuable reports, potentially integrating Finance and H&S data."
    ]
  },
  "auditSummary": {
    "overallAssessment": "The tool is well-structured and provides significant value. The data preparation and reporting logic successfully transform raw data into actionable insights.",
    "keyStrengths": [
      "Robust data preparation pipeline in 'TrendAnalysis.gs', including transparent imputation (LOCF).",
      "Highly effective consolidated reports ('Consolidated Support Needs', 'Focus Areas') that synthesize multiple metrics into a single, actionable 'support need level'."
    ],
    "criticalFinding": "A logical gap exists where the 'Reporting.gs' script depends on calculated columns ('average', 'totaltrend', specific survey columns like 's4ss25') that are not generated by the 'TrendAnalysis.gs' script. This indicates a missing automated step, making the current workflow reliant on a manual process and not robust or auditable."
  },
  "actionableRecommendations": [
    {
      "task": "Close the Data Gap and Future-Proof Logic",
      "priority": "Critical",
      "objective": "Create a fully automated, self-contained data pipeline that is resilient to future survey periods.",

        {
          "file": "TrendAnalysis.gs",
          "function": "generateSiteScoreSummaryTable",
          "action": "Modify this function to programmatically add and calculate the following columns for each site in the 'JLSiteScoreSummary' sheet: 'Survey Count', 'Average Score', 'Total Trend', 'Latest Score', and 'Previous Score'. The latter two should dynamically identify the most recent survey periods from the headers."
        },
        {
          "file": "Reporting.gs",
          "function": "All reporting functions",
          "action": "Refactor all report-generating functions to stop using hardcoded column names (e.g., 's4ss25'). Instead, they should reference the new, dynamically populated 'Latest Score' and 'Previous Score' columns from the 'JLSiteScoreSummary' sheet."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "task": "Implement Qualitative Feedback Analysis",

      "steps": [
        {
          "file": "Documentation / New Process",
          "action": "Document a workflow where survey data (Score and Comment) is exported. This data can then be provided to an LLM (like Gemini) to perform sentiment analysis and flag inconsistencies (e.g., low score with positive text)."
        },
        {
          "file": "Reporting.gs",
          "function": "New function: _generateFeedbackConsistencyReport",
          "action": "Create a new report that ingests the AI-analyzed data and highlights only the rows where the score and sentiment are inconsistent, enabling targeted follow-up."

          "file": "Reporting.gs",
          "function": "_generateAllThemeBreakdownReports",
          "action": "Implement the logic for this existing placeholder function. It should generate a separate report for each major theme (e.g., 'Cleaning'), showing the top and bottom 6 performing sites for that specific theme."

    {
      "task": "Integrate Financial & H&S Data for Strategic Insight",
